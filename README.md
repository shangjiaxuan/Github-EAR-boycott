# Github-EAR-boycott

The new Github Terms and Conditions enforces EAR on all Github users. 
This can be a great threat to the open source society as a whole,
and I am prompting a boycott by preparing to migrate original open source work to other hosting services.

## What is new about the terms and conditions

The new EAR terms and conditions as seen [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-and-export-controls) publicly acknowleges GitHub 
as a US asset, and all users, regardless of where s/he actually comes from will need to comply to US export laws. Consider two 
non-American (very likely to include open-source in the future if this nonsense continues) developers needing the US government to judge 
their collaboration. I consider this detrimental to the international GitHub user community and sould NOT be embraced.

## What we can do

GitHub of course offers very much irreplacable service in terms of stability and has a thriving community of developers at the moment.
I am not prompting trying to "overthrow" GitHub, but to have a defensive position when things get worse. I am prompting to mirror and 
make preparations to migrate original work from GitHub in case things get out of hand, and even open-source repos need to be 
American-censored with all the nonsense going on.
